ugrep: universal grep
=====================

A high-performance universal search utility finds Unicode patterns in
UTF-8/16/32, ASCII, ISO-8859-1, EBCDIC, code pages 437, 850, 858, 1250 to 1258,
and other file formats.

**ugrep** uses [RE/flex](https://github.com/Genivia/RE-flex) for
high-performance regex matching, which is 100 times faster than the GNU C
POSIX.2 regex library used by the grep utility and 10 times faster than PCRE2
and RE2.

**ugrep** matches Unicode regex patterns.  The regular expression syntax is
POSIX ERE compliant, extended with Unicode character classes, lazy quantifiers,
and negative patterns to skip unwanted pattern matches to produce more precise
results.

**ugrep** searches UTF-encoded input when UTF BOM
([byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)) are present
and ASCII and UTF-8 when no UTF BOM is present.  Option `--file-format` permits
many other file formats to be searched, such as ISO-8859-1, EBCDIC, and code
pages 437, 850, 858, 1250 to 1258.

**ugrep** uses command-line options that are compatible with GNU
[grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html).

**ugrep** is currently in beta release with new features being added in the
near future.

Regex patterns are converted to
[DFAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) for fast
matching.  Rare and pathelogical cases are known to exist that may increase the
initial running time for DFA construction.  The resulting DFAs still yield
significant speedups to search large files.

If you find **ugrep** interesting, feel free to share, distribute, contribute,
or let us know what you like, dislike, or want to see in future releases!

Dependencies
------------

Installation
------------

    $ ./configure; make

This builds `ugrep` in the `src` directory:

    $ src/ugrep -V
    ugrep 1.1.0 x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0

Optionally, install the ugrep utility and the ugrep manual page:

    $ sudo make install
    $ ugrep -V
    ugrep 1.1.0 x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0

Examples
--------

### 1) display lines containing Unicode words

To display lines with Unicode words in `places.txt`:

    ugrep '\w+' places.txt

To include the line and column numbers and color-highlight the matches:

    ugrep -n -k --color '\w+' places.txt

To produce a sorted list of all Unicode words in `places.txt`:

    ugrep -o '\w+' places.txt | sort -u

To display the byte offset of the matches next to the matching word, counting
from the start of the file:

    ugrep -b -o '\w+' places.txt

### 2) display lines containing Unicode characters

To display all lines containing laughing face emojis in `birthday.txt`:

    ugrep '[üòÄ-üòè]' birthday.txt

Likewise, we can use:

    ugrep '[\x{1F600}-\x{1F60F}]' birthday.txt

### 3) display lines containing Unicode names

To display lines containing the names G√∂del (or Goedel), Escher, or Bach:

    ugrep 'G(√∂|oe)del|Escher|Bach' GEB.txt wiki.txt

To display lines that do not contain the names G√∂del (or Goedel), Escher, or
Bach:

    ugrep -v 'G(√∂|oe)del|Escher|Bach' GEB.txt wiki.txt

### 4) count lines containing Unicode names

To count the number of lines containing the names G√∂del (or Goedel), Escher, or
Bach:

    ugrep -c 'G(√∂|oe)del|Escher|Bach' GEB.txt wiki.txt

To count the total number of occurrences of the names G√∂del (or Goedel),
Escher, or Bach:

    ugrep -c -g 'G(√∂|oe)del|Escher|Bach' GEB.txt wiki.txt

### 5) check if a file contains any non-ASCII (i.e. Unicode) characters

To check if `myfile` contains any non-ASCII Unicode character:

    ugrep -q '[^[:ascii:]]' myfile && echo "contains Unicode"

To invert the match:

    ugrep -v -q '[^[:ascii:]]' myfile && echo "does not contain Unicode"

### 6) searching UTF-encoded files

To search for `lorem` in a UTF-16 file:

    ugrep 'lorem' utf16lorem.txt

To make sure we match `lorem` as a word in lower/upper case:

    ugrep -w -i 'lorem' utf16lorem.txt

When utf16lorem.txt has no UTF-16 BOM:

    ugrep --file-format=UTF-16 -w -i 'lorem' utf16lorem.txt

### 7) searching for identifiers in source code

To search for the identifier `main` as a word:

    ugrep -nk -o '\<main\>' myfile.cpp

This also finds `main` in strings.  We can use a "negative pattern" to ignore
unwanted matches in C/C++ quoted strings (C/C++ strings are matched with
`"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*"` and may span multiple lines, so we should use
option `-o` to block-buffer the input):

    ugrep -nk -o -e '\<main\>' -e '(?^"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*")' myfile.cpp

We can use a negative pattern to also ignore unwanted matches in C/C++
comments:

    ugrep -nk -o -e '\<main\>' -e '(?^"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*"|//.*|/\*([^*]|\*[^/])*\*/)' myfile.cpp

To produce a sorted list of all Unicode identifiers in Java source code while
skipping strings and comments:

    ugrep -o -e '\p{JavaIdentifierStart}\p{JavaIdentifierPart}*' -e '(?^"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*"|//.*|/\*([^*]|\*[^/])*\*/)' myfile.java | sort -u

    NAME
           ugrep -- universal file pattern searcher

    SYNOPSIS
           ugrep [-bcEFGgHhikLlmnoqsTVvwxZ] [--colour[=when]|--color[=when]]
                 [-e pattern] [--free-space] [--label[=label]] [--tabs=size]
                 [pattern] [file ...]

    DESCRIPTION
           The  ugrep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that
           match one or more patterns.  By default, a  pattern  matches  an  input
           line  if  the  regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input
           line without its trailing newline.  An empty expression  matches  every
           line.   Each  input  line  that matches at least one of the patterns is
           written to the standard output.

           The ugrep utility normalizes Unicode input, so ugrep  can  be  used  to
           search  for  Unicode  patterns  in text files encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16,
           UTF-32 by detecting UTF BOM in the input.  When no UTF BOM is detected,
           ugrep  searches  for  Unicode  patterns  in UTF-8 input, which includes
           ASCII input.  ugrep searches input files encoded in ISO-8859-1, EBCDIC,
           CP-437,  CP-850,  CP-858,  CP-1250  to  CP-1258 when the file format is
           specified as an option.

           The following options are available:

           -b, --byte-offset
                  The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is displayed  in  front
                  of the respective matched line.

           -c, --count
                  Only  a  count  of selected lines is written to standard output.
                  When used with option -g, counts the number of patterns matched.

           --colour[=when], --color[=when]
                  Mark  up  the  matching  text  with the expression stored in the
                  GREP_COLOR or GREP_COLORS environment  variable.   The  possible
                  values of when can be `never', `always' or `auto'.

           -E, --extended-regexp
                  Interpret  patterns as extended regular expressions (EREs). This
                  is the default.

           -e pattern, --regexp=pattern
                  Specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an  input
                  line  is  selected  if it matches any of the specified patterns.
                  This option is most useful when multiple -e options are used  to
                  specify  multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash
                  (`-').

           --file-format=format
                  The input file format.  The possible values of  format  can  be:
                  binary  ISO-8859-1  ASCII  EBCDIC UTF-8 UTF-16 UTF-16BE UTF-16LE
                  UTF-32 UTF-32BE UTF-32LE CP-437 CP-850  CP-855  CP-1250  CP-1251
                  CP-1252 CP-1253 CP-1254 CP-1255 CP-1256 CP-1257 CP-1258

           -F, --fixed-strings
                  Interpret pattern as a set of fixed strings (i.e. force ugrep to
                  behave as fgrep but less efficiently).

           --free-space
                  Spacing (blanks and tabs) in regular expressions are ignored.

           -G, --basic-regexp
                  Interpret pattern as a  basic  regular  expression  (i.e.  force
                  ugrep to behave as traditional grep).

           -g, --no-group
                  Do  not  group  pattern  matches  on the same line.  Display the
                  matched line again for each additional pattern match.

           -H, --with-filename
                  Always print the  filename  with  output  lines.   This  is  the
                  default when there is more than one file to search.

           -h, --no-filename
                  Never print filenames with output lines.

           -?, --help
                  Print a help message.

           -i, --ignore-case
                  Perform   case   insensitive   matching.   This  option  applies
                  case-insensitive matching of ASCII characters in the input.   By
                  default, ugrep is case sensitive.

           -k, --column-number
                  The  column number of a matched pattern is displayed in front of
                  the respective matched line, starting at  column  1.   Tabs  are
                  expanded before columns are counted.

           -L, --files-without-match
                  Only  the names of files not containing selected lines are writ-
                  ten to standard output.  Pathnames  are  listed  once  per  file
                  searched.   If  the  standard  input  is  searched,  the  string
                  ``(standard input)'' is written.

           -l, --files-with-matches
                  Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
                  standard  output.   ugrep  will only search a file until a match
                  has been found,  making  searches  potentially  less  expensive.
                  Pathnames  are  listed  once per file searched.  If the standard
                  input is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.

           --label[=label]
                  Displays the label value when input is read from standard  input
                  where a file name would normally be printed in the output.  This
                  option applies to options -H, -L, and -l.

           -m num, --max-count=num
                  Stop reading the input after num matches.

           -n, --line-number
                  Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in  the
                  file,  starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for
                  each file processed.

           -o, --only-matching
                  Prints only the matching part of the lines.   Allows  a  pattern
                  match to span multiple lines.

           -q, --quiet, --silent
                  Quiet  mode:  suppress  normal output.  ugrep will only search a
                  file until a match has been found, making  searches  potentially
                  less  expensive.  Allows a pattern match to span multiple lines.

           -s, --no-messages
                  Silent mode.  Nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored (i.e.
                  their error messages are suppressed).

           -T, --initial-tab
                  Make  sure  that  the first character of the actual line content
                  lies on a tab stop when displayed.

           --tabs=size
                  Set the tab size to 1, 2, 4, or 8 to expand tabs for option  -k.

           -V, --version
                  Display version information and exit.

           -v, --invert-match
                  Selected  lines are those not matching any of the specified pat-
                  terns.

           -w, --word-regexp
                  The pattern is searched for as a word (as if surrounded by  `\<'
                  and `\>').

           -x, --line-regexp
                  Only  input lines selected against an entire pattern are consid-
                  ered to be matching lines (as if surrounded by ^ and $).

           -Z, --null
                  Prints a zero-byte after the file name.

           The regular expression pattern syntax is an extended form of the  POSIX
           ERE syntax.  For an overview of the syntax see README.md or visit:

                  https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep

           Note  that  `.'  matches any non-newline character.  Matching a newline
           character is not possible in line-buffered mode.  Pattern  matches  may
           span  multiple lines in block-buffered mode, which is enabled by one of
           the options -c, -o, or -q (unless combined with option -v).

           If no file arguments are specified, or if `-' is specified,  the  stan-
           dard input is used.

    EXIT STATUS
           The ugrep utility exits with one of the following values:

           0      One or more lines were selected.

           1      No lines were selected.

           >1     An error occurred.

    ENVIRONMENT
           GREP_COLOR
                  May  be used to specify ANSI SGR parameters to highlight matches
                  when option --color is used, e.g. 1;35;40 shows pattern  matches
                  in bold magenta text on a black background.

           GREP_COLORS
                  May  be used to specify ANSI SGR parameters to highlight matches
                  and other attributes when option --color is used.  Its value  is
                  a  colon-separated  list of ANSI SGR parameters that defaults to
                  mt=1;31:fn=35:ln=32:cn=32:bn=32:se=36.  The mt=,  ms=,  and  mc=
                  capabilities of GREP_COLORS have priority over GREP_COLOR.

    GREP_COLORS
           sl=    SGR substring for selected lines.

           cx=    SGR substring for context lines.

           rv     Swaps the sl= and cx= capabilities when -v is specified.

           mt=    SGR substring for matching text in any matching line.

           ms=    SGR  substring  for  matching text in a selected line.  The sub-
                  string mt= by default.

           mc=    SGR substring for matching text in a  context  line.   The  sub-
                  string mt= by default.

           fn=    SGR substring for file names.

           ln=    SGR substring for line numbers.

           cn=    SGR substring for column numbers.

           bn=    SGR substring for byte offsets.

           se=    SGR substring for separators.

    EXAMPLES
           To find all occurrences of the word `patricia' in a file:

                  $ ugrep -w 'patricia' myfile

           To  count the number of lines containing the word `patricia' or `Patri-
           cia` in a file:

                  $ ugrep -cw '[Pp]atricia' myfile

           To count the total number of times the word  `patricia'  or  `Patricia`
           occur in a file:

                  $ ugrep -cgw '[Pp]atricia' myfile

           To list all Unicode words in a file:

                  $ ugrep -o '\w+' myfile

           To  list  all  laughing  face  emojis  (Unicode  code points U+1F600 to
           U+1F60F) in a file:

                  $ ugrep -o '[\x{1F600}-\x{1F60F}]' myfile

           To check if a file contains any non-ASCII (i.e. Unicode) characters:

                  $ ugrep -q '[^[:ascii:]]' myfile && echo "contains Unicode"

           To list all C/C++ comments in a file displaying their line  and  column
           numbers using options -n and -k, and option -o that allows for matching
           patterns across multiple lines:

                  $ ugrep -nko -e '//.*' -e '/\*([^*]|\*[^/])*\*/' myfile

           To list the lines that need fixing in a C/C++ source  file  by  looking
           for  the word FIXME while skipping any FIXME in quoted strings by using
           a negative pattern `(?^X)' to ignore quoted strings:

                  $ ugrep -no -e 'FIXME' -e '(?^"(\\.|\\\r?\n|[^\\\n"])*")' myfile

ugrep versus grep
-----------------

- Regular expression patterns are more expressive, see further below.  Extended
  regular expression syntax is the default (i.e. option `-E`, as egrep).
- When option `-o` or option `-q` is used, ugrep searches by file instead of
  by line, matching patterns that include newlines (`\n`), allowing a pattern
  match to span multiple lines.  This is not possible with grep.
- When option `-b` is used with option `-o` or with option `-g`, ugrep displays
  the exact byte offset of the pattern match instead of the byte offset of the
  start of the matched line.  Reporting exact byte offsets makes more sense.
- New option `-g`, `--no-group` to not group matches per line, a ugrep feature.
  This option displays a matched input line again for each additional pattern
  match.  This option is useful with option `-c` to report the total number of
  pattern matches per file instead of the number of lines matched per file.
- New option `-k`, `--column-number` to display the column number, taking tab
  spacing into account by expanding tabs, as specified by new option `--tabs`.

Wanted - TODO
-------------

- Like grep, traverse directory contents to search files, and support options `-R` and `-r`, `--recursive`.
- Like grep, display context with `-A`, `-B`, and `-C`, `--context`.
- Like grep, read patterns from a file with `-f`, `--file=file`.
- Should detect "binary files" like grep and skip them?
- Open files in binary mode "rb" when `--binary-files` option is specified?
- ...

Bugs - FIXME
------------

- Pattern `^$` does not match empty lines, because `find()` does not permit
  empty matches.
- Back-references are not supported.
- There are reported cases where lazy quantifiers misbehave, best to avoid them
  unless the patterns are simple.

Pattern syntax
--------------

A pattern is an extended set of regular expressions, with nested sub-expression
patterns `œÜ` and `œà`:

  Pattern   | Matches
  --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------
  `x`       | matches the character `x`, where `x` is not a special character
  `.`       | matches any single character except newline (unless in dotall mode)
  `\.`      | matches `.` (dot), special characters are escaped with a backslash
  `\n`      | matches a newline, others are `\a` (BEL), `\b` (BS), `\t` (HT), `\v` (VT), `\f` (FF), and `\r` (CR)
  `\0`      | matches the NUL character
  `\cX`     | matches the control character `X` mod 32 (e.g. `\cA` is `\x01`)
  `\0177`   | matches an 8-bit character with octal value `177`
  `\x7f`    | matches an 8-bit character with hexadecimal value `7f`
  `\x{3B1}` | matches Unicode character U+03B1, i.e. `Œ±`
  `\u{3B1}` | matches Unicode character U+03B1, i.e. `Œ±`
  `\p{C}`   | matches a character in category C
  `\Q...\E` | matches the quoted content between `\Q` and `\E` literally
  `[abc]`   | matches one of `a`, `b`, or `c`
  `[0-9]`   | matches a digit `0` to `9`
  `[^0-9]`  | matches any character except a digit
  `œÜ?`      | matches `œÜ` zero or one time (optional)

The order of precedence for composing larger patterns from sub-patterns is as
follows, from high to low precedence:

  1. Characters, character classes (bracket expressions), escapes, quotation
  2. Grouping `(œÜ)`, `(?:œÜ)`, `(?=œÜ)`, and inline modifiers `(?imsux:œÜ)`
  3. Quantifiers `?`, `*`, `+`, `{n,m}`
  4. Concatenation `œÜœà`
  5. Anchoring `^`, `$`, `\<`, `\>`, `\b`, `\B`, `\A`, `\z` 
  6. Alternation `œÜ|œà`
  7. Global modifiers `(?imsux)œÜ`

### POSIX and Unicode character classes

Character classes in bracket lists represent sets of characters.  Sets can be
inverted, subtracted, intersected, and merged:

  Pattern           | Matches
  ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  `[a-zA-Z]`        | matches a letter
  `[^a-zA-Z]`       | matches a non-letter (character class inversion)
  `[a-z‚àí‚àí[aeiou]]`  | matches a consonant (character class subtraction)
  `[a-z&&[^aeiou]]` | matches a consonant (character class intersection)
  `[a-z‚éÆ‚éÆ[A-Z]]`    | matches a letter (character class union)

Bracket lists cannot be empty, so `[]` and `[^]` are invalid.  In fact, the
first character after the bracket is always part of the list.  So `[][]` is a
list that matches a `]` and a `[`, `[^][]` is a list that matches anything but
`]` and `[`, and `[-^]` is a list that matches a `-` and a `^`.

### POSIX and Unicode character categories

  POSIX form   | POSIX category    | Matches
  ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------
  `[:ascii:]`  | `\p{ASCII}`       | matches any ASCII character
  `[:space:]`  | `\p{Space}`       | matches a white space character `[ \t\n\v\f\r]`
  `[:xdigit:]` | `\p{Xdigit}`      | matches a hex digit `[0-9A-Fa-f]`
  `[:cntrl:]`  | `\p{Cntrl}`       | matches a control character `[\x00-\0x1f\x7f]`
  `[:print:]`  | `\p{Print}`       | matches a printable character `[\x20-\x7e]`
  `[:alnum:]`  | `\p{Alnum}`       | matches a alphanumeric character `[0-9A-Za-z]`
  `[:alpha:]`  | `\p{Alpha}`       | matches a letter `[A-Za-z]`
  `[:blank:]`  | `\p{Blank}`, `\h` | matches a blank `[ \t]`
  `[:digit:]`  | `\p{Digit}`, `\d` | matches a digit `[0-9]`
  `[:graph:]`  | `\p{Graph}`       | matches a visible character `[\x21-\x7e]`
  `[:lower:]`  |                   | matches a lower case letter `[a-z]`
  `[:punct:]`  | `\p{Punct}`       | matches a punctuation character `[\x21-\x2f\x3a-\x40\x5b-\x60\x7b-\x7e]`
  `[:upper:]`  |                   | matches an upper case letter `[A-Z]`
  `[:word:]`   |                   | matches a word character `[0-9A-Za-z_]`
  `[:^digit:]` | `\D`              | matches a non-digit `[^0-9]`
  `[:^blank:]` | `\H`              | matches a non-blank character `[^ \t]`

The POSIX form can only be used in bracket lists, for example
`[[:lower:][:digit:]]` matches an ASCII lower case letter or a digit.  

You can also use the capitalized `\P{C}` form that has the same meaning as
`\p{^C}`, which matches any character except characters in the class `C`.
For example, `\P{ASCII}` is the same as `\p{^ASCII}` which is the same as
`[^[:ascii:]]`.  A word of caution: because POSIX character categories only
cover ASCII, `[[:^ascii]]` is empty and invalid to use.  By contrast,
`[^[:ascii]]` is a Unicode character class that excludes the ASCII character
category.

To specify a Unicode block as a category use `\p{IsBlockName}` with a Unicode
`BlockName`.

To specify a Unicode language script, use `\p{Language}` with a Unicode
`Language`.

Unicode language script character classes differ from the Unicode blocks that
have a similar name.  For example, the `\p{Greek}` class represents Greek and
Coptic letters and differs from the Unicode block `\p{IsGreek}` that spans a
specific Unicode block of Greek and Coptic characters only, which also includes
unassigned characters.
